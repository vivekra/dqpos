# files.yaml
#
# Files initially inserted into the system. Canned responses have their own
# method for attachments; however, this file will make it easier to add
# thinkgs like inline images.
#
# NOTE: If the files aren't attached to something by the installer, they
# bill be cleaned up shortly after installation (by the autocron).
